This is the suggested template for new FLIPs.

Note that a FLIP number will be assigned by an editor.
When opening a pull request to submit your FLIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, e.g., `flip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less.

## Summary (2-5 sentences)

"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the issue.

## Motivation

The motivation is critical to change the Factlink protocol.
It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate with respect to the issue raised.

## Technical Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of the proposed solution for the issue raised.
If a suggestion is proposed, provide sufficient details so that an implementation would be possible (Proof of Concepts are acceptable).

## Rationale

The rationale should flesh out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made, as well as any alternative designs that were considered.

## Implementation

An implementation must be completed before any FLIP proceeds to “Last Call” status.

## Security considerations

All FLIPs must include a discussion of the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change as well as proposed mitigations.
A FLIP cannot proceed to “Final” status without a sufficient security review from the core team.
